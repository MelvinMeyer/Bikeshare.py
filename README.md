# Explore US Bikeshare Data 
This is my second project for Programming for Data Science Nanodegree with Python.

# Overview 
In this project, I will explore the data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City and Washington. With the project workspace provided by udacity or with python, I will write a code to import data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will write a script that inputs raw data to give an interavtive experience in the terminal to present these stastics. 

# Software needed to complete Project:
The following software was used to complete Project 2:

•	Python or Udacity Workspace

•	A text editor: Atom

•	A terminal Application: Git Bash

# The Datasets
The data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for major cities in United States. In this Project, I will use the data to compare the system usage between three large cities: Cities, New York City and Washington. Random data for all three cities are provided for the first six months of 2017. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

• Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

• End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

• Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

• Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

• End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

• User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Chicago and New York City also contain the following columns:

• Gender

• Birth year 

# Explored Questions
The code written in this project are used to answer the following questions about bike share data:

• What is the most common month for start time?

• What is the most common day of week for start time?

• What is the most common hour of day for start time?

• What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?

• What is the most common trip?

• What are the counts of each user type?

• What are the counts of gender?

• What are the earliest, most recent and most common birth years? 

# Resources used to complete project
• Lessons provided by udacity in the Introduction to Data Science with Python helped build my knowledge to complete the project.
